# MSAN-CNN



This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper 'Weakly-supervised framework for cancer regions detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in whole-slide pathological images based on multi-scale attention convolutional neural network',  and We'll refine the data and code over time.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- PyTorch 1.9.0
- python 3.8.5
- Torchvision 0.10.0
- numpy and so on
### Data
- train data
- validation data
- test data

## Training and Validation
Training a network with default arguments. Model checkpoints and tensorboard logs are written out to a unique directory created by default within experiments/models and experiments/logs respectively after starting training.
If conditions permit, it will be better to pre-train the model first.
```javascript 
python main.py
```

## Testing
You can run validation and testing on the checkpointed best model by:
```javascript 
python main.py
```
